This is crucial to improving understanding of the challenges of language learning outside of classrooms.\n\nIt has been adapted for use by the Centre for Advanced Studies in Language and Education (CASLE) at the University of York (UK) to assist in their research studies.";

When we report the results of the project, all information will be anonymized.";
